# Starbucks-Billing-System

☕ **Starbucks Billing System (Python)**

This project is a console-based billing application developed in Python.
It simulates a Starbucks-style billing counter where a user can place coffee/tea orders, and the program automatically generates a digital bill with all charges and discounts.

📌 **Features**

✅ Interactive item selection (Yes/No for each menu item)

✅ User-defined quantity for each item

✅ Auto calculation of Subtotal, GST (18%), and Discount (10% if subtotal > ₹500)

✅ Professional digital receipt with neat formatting

✅ Beginner-friendly and easy to customize

📖 **Menu Items**
Item	Price (₹)
Cold Coffee	180
Hot Coffee	140
Cappuccino	240
Tea	60
Mocha	210

🚀 **How It Works**

Program displays a welcome message.

User is asked whether they want each item from the menu.

If yes, user enters the quantity.

The program calculates subtotal based on the chosen items.

GST (18%) is applied automatically.

If subtotal > ₹500, a 10% discount is applied.

A final bill is displayed in a neat format.

📋 Example Output
========== Welcome to Starbucks ==========

Cold Coffee  @ Rs.180 x 2 = Rs.360
Cappuccino   @ Rs.240 x 1 = Rs.240
Mocha        @ Rs.210 x 1 = Rs.210
----------------------------------------
Subtotal: Rs.810
GST (18%): Rs.145.80
Discount (10%): -Rs.81.00
========================================
Total Bill Amount: Rs.874.80
